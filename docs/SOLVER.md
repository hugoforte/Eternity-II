# The solver

How the search works, why it is built this way, and the measurements behind
the default settings. For the options exposed in the UI see
[SETTINGS.md](SETTINGS.md).

## Running the solver on its own

The solver is a plain Java program; the web app is only a front end for it.

```sh
sh build.sh                                   # compile into java/classes
sh test.sh                                    # 958 checks, a few seconds

java -cp java/classes core.MrvSolver          # MRV solver on Eternity II
java -cp java/classes core.MrvSolver 50000000 # stop after 50M steps
java -cp java/classes core.Solver             # the older row-major solver
java -cp java/classes core.Bench              # benchmarks
java -cp java/classes core.AllTests           # the test suite
java -cp java/classes app.Engine --nodeBudget=300000   # the JSONL engine, by hand
```

## What was implemented

### 1. Bitset piece pool

A *variant* is a (piece, rotation) pair, numbered `v = pieceId * 4 + rot`. Because 4 divides 64,
**all four variants of a piece live in one 64-bit word**, at word `id >>> 4`, bit offset `(id & 15) << 2`.
Using or releasing a piece is therefore a single machine instruction:

```java
avail[id >>> 4] &= ~pieceBits(id);        // use
avail[id >>> 4] |=  existPieceBits[id];   // release
```

Colour constraints are bitsets too: `maskL[c]`, `maskT[c]`, `maskR[c]`, `maskB[c]` hold the variants whose
left/top/right/bottom side is colour `c`, plus `notGreyL/T/R/B` for interior edges.

Each empty cell caches a **constraint mask** = the intersection of the four side masks implied by its
borders and its currently-placed neighbours. A cell's legal candidates are `cellMask[cell] & avail`, and
iterating them is `Long.numberOfTrailingZeros` in a loop.

Rotationally-symmetric pieces have their duplicate orientations folded away, so the search never
enumerates the same physical board twice — this is what makes exact solution **counting** possible.

### 2. MRV (most-constrained-variable) cell ordering

At each node the solver takes the empty cell with the fewest candidates. Two things fall out for free:

* **Whole-board forward checking.** If *any* empty cell has zero candidates we backtrack immediately.
  The old `Solver` only checked the two cells next to the one just filled.
* **Free forced moves.** Cells with exactly one candidate are always taken first, so chains of forced
  placements cost almost nothing.

Selection is fully deterministic (fewest candidates → most placed neighbours → lowest index), because the
tests compare exact node and solution counts.

`useMrv = false` switches to lowest-index ordering while keeping all the bitset machinery. That isolates
the heuristic for benchmarking, and the test suite uses it to prove that cell ordering does not change the
*set* of solutions.

### 3. Making MRV affordable

A naive MRV implementation popcounts every word of every empty cell at every node. Three things fix that:

1. **Incremental counts.** `cellCount[cell]` is kept up to date. When piece `id` is used, `avail` loses
   exactly `existPieceBits[id]`, all in one word, so every other empty cell's count drops by
   `popcount(cellMask[cell][thatWord] & thatMask)` — **one** word access and **one** popcount per cell
   instead of 16 of each.
2. **Subset tightening.** When a neighbour gains a placed neighbour, its constraint on the facing side
   goes from "not grey" to "exactly colour c", and `maskX[c] ⊆ notGreyX` for non-grey `c`. So the new mask
   is just `oldMask & maskX[c]` — a plain AND, not a four-way intersection. (The facing colour is
   guaranteed non-grey because the cell's own mask forbade grey on sides facing an empty on-board
   neighbour. There is a documented fallback if an instance ever violates that.)
3. **Saved-copy undo.** Intersection is not invertible, so `place()` saves the ≤4 touched neighbour masks
   and `unplace()` restores them instead of recomputing.

Measured effect of (1) alone on Eternity II: **0.77M → 1.16M nodes/sec**.
The mask array is stored word-major, which measured ~4% faster than cell-major.

## Measured results

### Eternity II, 20 seconds each

| Solver | nodes/sec | pieces placed |
|---|---|---|
| `Solver` (row-major + one-step forward check) | **16.2 M** | 191 / 256 |
| `MrvSolver` (MRV + bitsets + whole-board check) | 1.24 M | **198 / 256** |

MRV does ~13× more work per node but explores a far better tree.

### Time to first solution on solvable instances

MRV vs lowest-index ordering **inside the same bitset machinery**, so only the heuristic differs.
5 seeds each, 2M node cap:

| board | colours | regime | MRV nodes | MRV ms | rowMajor nodes | rowMajor ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6×6 | 5 | **hard** | **264 841** | **125** | 2 861 620 | 557 |
| 8×8 | 12 | easy | 271 594 | 127 | **77 154** | **22** |
| 8×8 | 7 | too hard (0/5 both) | 10 000 000 | 4309 | 10 000 000 | 2860 |
| 10×10 | 24 | easy | 22 914 | 14 | **13 995** | **3** |
| 12×12 | 30 | easy | 42 198 | 32 | **37 973** | **16** |

**The honest conclusion: MRV is a big win in the hard regime and a mild loss in easy regimes.**
On the 6×6 hard-regime row it cuts nodes by **10.8×** and wall-clock by **4.5×**. On loosely-constrained
instances any ordering works, so the heuristic's overhead is wasted.

Eternity II (16×16, 22 colours) sits squarely in the hard regime, which is the case MRV is built for —
and is also exactly why the puzzle is unsolved.

### The phase transition

Generated instances show the classic random-CSP hardness peak. Worst case over several seeds, 2–3M node cap:

| board | colours | result |
|---|---|---|
| 8×8 | 4 | solved, ≤ 290k nodes |
| 8×8 | 5–8 | **often unsolved** (hard region) |
| 8×8 | 10–12 | solved, ≤ 190k nodes |
| 16×16 | 22 (E2-like) | unsolved |
| 16×16 | 64 | solved, 3.5k nodes |
| 20×20 | 96 | solved, 4.8k nodes |

So the solver scales to and beyond the real board size when the instance is not in the hard region.

## The test suite

`java -cp out core.AllTests` → **958 checks, 0 failures, ~2.5 s.** No JUnit dependency; `T.java` is a
60-line assertion helper so the suite runs with nothing but a JDK. Exits 1 on failure for CI.

| Test file | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `SidesTest` | Pack/unpack round-trips for every colour combination; `rotateCW` is `{l,t,r,b}→{b,l,t,r}`; four rotations are the identity; grey counting and corner-adjacency. |
| `PiecesTest` | Guards the **board design**: 256 pieces, colours 0–22, exactly 4 corners / 56 edges / 196 interior, corner greys adjacent, grey total == 4·16, piece 139's sides and its rotation-1 orientation. |
| `InstanceTest` | Instance geometry and invariants, canonical-rotation logic, `piecesCopy` independence, and 9 input-validation rejections. |
| `GeneratorTest` | The generator produces well-formed, solvable instances: correct corner/edge/interior counts for every size, exact grey budget, no grey on interior edges, determinism per seed. |
| `ValidatorTest` | That the checker **rejects** what it should: duplicated pieces, a rotated piece, swapped pieces, a coloured side facing off-board, a moved fixed piece, bad ids, wrong sizes. A validator that always passed would invalidate the whole suite. |
| `SolverConfigTest` | The configurable options: parsing and clamping of all 14 settings, every value solving correctly, and the two invariants that catch almost any plumbing mistake — changing the look-ahead level or the cell order must never change how many solutions exist. |
| `SolverTest` | The **pre-existing** row-major solver: rotation table correctness, `cand[l][t]` keys, de-duplication, `candByTop` = union of `cand[*][t]`, all fixed-piece constants, bounded runs, determinism, and that its snapshot fills exactly a row-major prefix. |
| `MrvSolverTest` | The new machinery — see below. |
| `CrossValidationTest` | **The strongest evidence:** exhaustive solution counts vs the naive reference solver. |

### The three tests that matter most

**1. Cached masks vs brute force.** An independent, slow enumeration of the rules recomputes the legal
candidate set for every empty cell, and it must match the cached bitset masks — checked on the initial
state and after each of 12 random placements, on a 4×4, a 5×5 with a fixed piece, and the real 16×16 board.

**2. `place()`/`unplace()` is a perfect inverse.** Deep random walks (40 placements) followed by full
unwinding must restore `avail`, every cell mask, every cell count, the board, `used[]` and the placed
count **byte for byte**. This is the single most common source of bugs in a backtracking search, and it is
what let me safely add the subset-tightening optimisation afterwards.

**3. Incremental counts never drift.** `cellCount[]` is checked against full recomputation after *every*
place and *every* unplace, on four instances including Eternity II. Incremental counters that silently
diverge are exactly the failure mode of optimisation (2) and (3) above.

### Cross-validation results

`MrvSolver` is made to enumerate **every** solution of small instances and the totals are compared
against the naive `RefSolver`. All nine cases agree exactly:

| instance | solutions | ref nodes | mrv nodes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3×3, 1 colour | 576 | 8 529 | 1 026 |
| 3×3, 2 colours | 96 | 720 | 297 |
| 3×3, 3 colours, +fixed | 1 | 25 | 10 |
| 4×4, 2 colours | **5 184** | 1 211 960 | 30 808 |
| 4×4, 3 colours | 24 | 18 292 | 1 171 |
| 4×4, 3 colours, +fixed | 8 | 2 018 | 316 |
| 4×4, 4 colours | 8 | 1 649 | 340 |
| 5×5, 4 colours | 128 | 1 173 814 | 7 690 |
| 5×5, 5 colours, +fixed | 6 | 8 694 | 807 |

If MRV ordering, the bitset pruning, the rotation de-duplication or the "no grey in the interior"
assumption were wrong in any way, these counts would diverge. Unsatisfiable instances are also checked —
both solvers must report exactly 0.

## Bugs and limitations found along the way

* The original `forwardCheck` in `Solver.java` had a dead branch: it probed the below-neighbour's left
  constraint using a cell that row-major order had not filled yet. Fixed.
* Janino (the compiler used to verify this in a JRE-only sandbox) does not implement generics, so
  `Solver`'s table building was rewritten as an allocation-free two-pass count-then-fill. That is faster
  anyway. `Puzzle.java` needed an explicit `(int[])` cast on `clone()` for the same reason.
* **MRV is not a universal win.** It loses to plain row-major ordering on loosely-constrained instances.
  If you ever want the best of both, a hybrid that uses MRV only while the minimum candidate count is
  small would be the thing to try.

## What was deliberately not done

* **Conflict-driven backjumping / nogood learning** — analysed earlier as a poor return on this problem
  class once MRV and forward checking are in place.
* **Parallel search** — the remaining cheap multiplier. Split on the top-left corner piece × rotation and
  give each worker its own `MrvSolver`; state is only ~150 KB per worker. This is the obvious next step.
* **Randomised restarts.** Backtracking runtimes here are heavy-tailed (see the 8×8/7-colour row, where
  both orderings fail). Randomised value ordering plus restarts is the standard cure and would likely
  help more than any further micro-optimisation — at the cost of the determinism the tests rely on.
